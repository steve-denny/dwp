# Features

# OAuth2 (Keycloak-ready)
When feature.oauth2.enabled=true, OAuth2SecurityConfig protects endpoints via JWT.
Configure issuer/jwk via spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.*.

# Spring Cloud Config (Client)
When feature.configserver.enabled=true, @RefreshScope is enabled to pull config from a central server (if on classpath).

# Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j)
When feature.circuitbreaker.enabled=true, Circuit Breaker annotations are active. See ExternalSeatGatewayClient for example.

# Rate Limiter (In-memory Sliding Window)
When feature.ratelimiter.enabled=true, a global interceptor enforces request limits. Defaults:

ratelimiter.windowSeconds=10
ratelimiter.maxRequests=30


# Monitoring (Actuator)
When feature.monitoring.enabled=true, a custom health indicator customFeatureHealth is added.

# Maintenance Mode
Use:

app.maintenance.enabled=true
app.maintenance.message=Service is under scheduled maintenance


to return HTTP 503 for all routes temporarily.


# Future-Ready Features (Disabled by Default)
## üîß Optional Features (Feature Toggles)

All features below are implemented and **disabled by default**. Flip the flag to `true` in `application.properties` to enable, no code change required.

feature.oauth2.enabled=false
feature.configserver.enabled=false
feature.circuitbreaker.enabled=false
feature.ratelimiter.enabled=false
feature.monitoring.enabled=false


The application has been designed to support several advanced features for scalability, security, and observability. These are not enabled by default to simplify local testing and deployment.

1. OAuth2 / Spring Security with Keycloak

Purpose: Provides Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication and role-based authorization.

Current Status: Implemented as a placeholder. Disabled by default.

Enable:

Configure Keycloak server details in application.properties or external config.

Update Spring Security configuration to enable OAuth2 authentication.

Define roles and assign endpoints access rights.

Reference: Spring Security OAuth2

2. Spring Cloud Config Server / SCCS

Purpose: Externalized, centralized configuration for multiple environments (Dev, QA, Prod).

Current Status: Placeholder present, disabled by default.

Enable:

Run a Config Server and point the application‚Äôs spring.cloud.config.uri to it.
Also uncomment the code which is needed in respective files and add required dependency in pom.xml.

Externalize sensitive properties like ticket prices, max tickets, and feature toggles.

Restart the application to apply new configuration.

3. Circuit Breaker

Purpose: Improves resilience when calling external services (e.g., payment gateway, seat reservation) to prevent cascading failures.

Current Status: Placeholder only.

Enable:

Integrate with Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker (Resilience4J or Hystrix).

Wrap service calls in circuit breaker annotations.

Configure thresholds in properties.

4. Rate Limiter

Purpose: Prevents API abuse and controls request throughput.

Current Status: Placeholder only.

Enable:

Implement chosen strategy (Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Sliding Window, etc.).

Configure limits in application.properties.

Use Spring AOP or interceptor to enforce.

5. Monitoring & Alerting

Purpose: Track performance, latency, and errors in production.

Current Status: Placeholder.

Enable:

Integrate with Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana, or other observability tools.

Configure metrics endpoints and alerts.

# How to Toggle Features

All features are disabled by default in application.properties.

Future activation is controlled via boolean flags or external config, for example:

feature.oauth2.enabled=false
feature.configserver.enabled=false
feature.circuitbreaker.enabled=false
feature.ratelimiter.enabled=false
feature.monitoring.enabled=false

Setting true for any flag will enable the feature as per configuration.

# üîß Optional Features (Feature Toggles)

This project comes with several advanced features pre-integrated but disabled by default.
They can be enabled via configuration without any code change.

Default configuration (application.yml):

feature:
  oauth2:
    enabled: false
  configserver:
    enabled: false
  circuitbreaker:
    enabled: false
  ratelimiter:
    enabled: false
  monitoring:
    enabled: false

    
Available Features:

OAuth2 Authentication (feature.oauth2.enabled=true)
Enables Spring Security OAuth2 support for token-based authentication.

Spring Cloud Config Server (feature.configserver.enabled=true)
Allows the service to fetch configurations from a centralized Config Server.

Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j/Hystrix) (feature.circuitbreaker.enabled=true)
Provides resilience and fault-tolerance against dependent service failures.

Rate Limiter (feature.ratelimiter.enabled=true)
Controls the number of requests per second per user/client to prevent abuse.

Monitoring & Metrics (Micrometer/Prometheus/Actuator) (feature.monitoring.enabled=true)
Adds extended health, metrics, and monitoring endpoints.

üëâ By default, all are disabled to keep the service lightweight and fast.
üëâ To enable any, simply set the corresponding flag to true in application.yml or environment variables.

## Coverage

The code coverage report can be viewed here:

![Coverage Report](docs/JunitCoverage.jpg)

## Exception Handling

The project implements a centralized exception handling strategy using Spring Boot‚Äôs @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler annotations. This ensures consistent error responses across all endpoints.

#Key Points:

Centralized Handling:

All exceptions are caught and processed in a single GlobalExceptionHandler class.

Prevents duplicate error handling logic in controllers.

#Custom Exceptions:

InvalidPurchaseException is used to indicate invalid ticket purchase requests.

Future business rules can extend custom exceptions for better error clarity.

Standardized Response:

All error responses return a consistent JSON format:

{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-26T12:34:56",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid ticket request: Child/Infant requires an Adult ticket",
  "path": "/tickets/purchase"
}


Helps frontend/UI to uniformly parse and display error messages.

# Mapped Exception Types:

IllegalArgumentException ‚Üí 400 BAD REQUEST

InvalidPurchaseException ‚Üí 400 BAD REQUEST

MethodArgumentNotValidException ‚Üí 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY

HttpRequestMethodNotSupportedException ‚Üí 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED

Exception (fallback) ‚Üí 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

# Validation Errors:

Bean validation (Jakarta @NotNull, @Min, @Max, etc.) triggers structured validation messages.

Errors are aggregated and returned in a human-readable format.

# Extensibility:

New exception mappings can be easily added without impacting existing controllers.

Logging Integration:

All exceptions are logged using LoggingAspect and SLF4J.

Supports debugging while avoiding sensitive information leakage in client-facing responses.

## Business Rules & Validation

The application enforces all domain rules through a dedicated validation layer before any payment or seat reservation is processed. This ensures invalid purchase requests are rejected early, maintaining data integrity and consistent business behavior.

## Validator Implementation

Implemented in BusinessRulesValidator and BusinessRulesValidatorImpl.

Invoked directly by TicketServiceImpl before proceeding with business operations.

Keeps rules centralized, testable, and easy to extend in the future.

## Invalid Purchase Requests (Rejected Scenarios)

A purchase request is deemed invalid and immediately rejected if any of the following rules are violated:

Zero Tickets ‚Äì requests with no tickets are not allowed.

Child/Infant Without Adult ‚Äì Child and Infant tickets cannot be purchased without at least one Adult ticket.

Exceeding Maximum Ticket Limit ‚Äì more than 20 tickets per request is invalid.

Negative Quantities ‚Äì ticket quantities cannot be negative.

Null or Empty Requests ‚Äì malformed or incomplete requests are not accepted.

## Workflow

Incoming purchase request ‚Üí TicketServiceImpl.

BusinessRulesValidator checks all rules.

If validation fails ‚Üí throws a custom exception.

Exception is caught by GlobalExceptionHandler and returned as a proper error response.

Only valid requests move forward to payment and seat reservation.
